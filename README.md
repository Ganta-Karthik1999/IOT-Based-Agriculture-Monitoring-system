# IOT-Based-Agriculture-Monitoring-System

This project involves developing an IoT-based agriculture monitoring system that helps farmers monitor their fields remotely. The system uses various sensors to measure humidity, soil moisture, and water levels, transmitting data in real-time to a cloud platform.

## Introduction
This IoT-based agriculture monitoring system allows farmers to:
- Monitor soil moisture levels
- Track humidity and temperature
- Detect water levels
- View data in real-time on a cloud platform

## Features
- Real-time data monitoring
- Remote access to sensor data
- Alerts and notifications for critical conditions
- User-friendly dashboard for data visualization

## Components
- **NodeMCU (ESP8266)**
- **Arduino**
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**
- **Humidity and Temperature Sensor (DHT11/DHT22)**
- **Water Level Sensor**
- **Blynk App**
